# Wolfman Game Rule (Chinese Version)

## Roles

* Werewolves (狼人)

  Each night, the werewolves pick 1 player to kill. The victim can be anyone, including other werewolves. The next day,they pretend to be a villager and try to seem unsuspicious. The number of werewolves in a game varies depending on the number of players.

* Villagers (平民)

  They don't have any special power except thinking and the right to vote.

* Sheriff (警长)

  This card is given to a player besides their card. They are elected by a vote. This player's vote counts for 1.5 instead of one. If they die, they will decide who will be the next Sheriff or they can destroy the badge and there will be no sheriff. The Sheriff can be of any role, including a werewolf.

* Witch (女巫)

  She has two potions:

  * one to save the werewolves's victim
  * one to eliminate a player

  She can only use each potion once during the game. She can use both potions during the same night. She can save herself if she has been attacked by the werewolves on the first night.

  If the antidote is used, she will not be able to know who was attacked by wolves.

* Seer/ Fortune Teller/ Oracle/ Prophet (预言家)

  Each night, they can discover the real identity of a player. However, they can only verify if a player is a werewolf or not. They cannot see if a player has special power.

* Hunter (猎人)

  If they are killed by werewolves or eliminated by vote, they MAY kill another player of their choice. They CANNOT kill if they were poisoned to death by the witch.

* Guard (守卫)

  A Guard can guard a different player every night (include self). The guarded player will survive if killed by the werewolf. An exception is if a player is both guarded and saved by the witch, the player will die.

* Idiot (白痴)

  An idiot will not be voted to death. If the idot is voted to death, he will expose his role, and he will not die. However, he will lost his voting power. An idiot can only be killed in the night.

## Before game starts

There are two types of games players have to decide at the beginning on how the wolves can win the game:

1. Kill all (屠城)

   All other players' count is reduced to equal or less than the count of werewolves

2. Kill side (屠边)

   All villagers are killed, or all special charactors are killed.
